In this ongoing project I'm exploring the collection of bird genetic samples held at INPA, Manaus. 

I had previously revised this dataset with Microsoft Excel and Python, correcting records, standardizing some of the columns and georeferencing all records when possible.

My goal here was to explore the database in order to provide the institution:

* Some basic information about the collection's content in terms of taxonomic representativeness, type of material, methods of collection, and others.
* Identify potential data entries that need to be improved, standardized or well filled.
* Provide information to help the institution to make data-based decisions on future expeditions, collecting practices, etc...
* Provide data that will be helpfull in the future to acquire financial resources for research and improve public policy regarding biological collections.
* Give the people of Amazonia information about their genetic resources and the valuable public material the institution holds.

> Although most results are available at the jupyter notebook and gis folder I'm now working on a final digested report more accessible to the scientific and non scientific community.

**The original dataset will hopefully be available soon.
